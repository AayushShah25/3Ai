## About 3Ai:
This project primirely focues on the Face Detection - Recognition - Attendence - Report. There are many other features provided too to maintain the record of other people.
The main focus of this project was to create as much as we can with Neural Networks. We need to try our hands on them and we did. And of course it gives much better performance
on the recognition.

Here we have used 2 NNets, first is the Siamese to extract the face embeddings and the second is CNN to check the liveliness of the face. So that a person can't just show anyone's
face and make an attendence. 

Other features include: Reports, Adding / Removing person, Training model with new face, Showing Unknowns detected, Notification if someone is not getting identified and more.

## Prerequisits:
There are many dependencies that you need to install - I know it is intemedating, but for this timeâ€”you would have to.
